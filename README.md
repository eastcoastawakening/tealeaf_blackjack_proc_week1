# tealeaf_blackjack_proc_week1
This code is for the Tealeaf week1 assignment for Blackjack using procedures
This BlackJack game asks the Dealer for number of players and then the dealer deals two cards to all players.
Then the dealer deals two cards to herself.
The game uses <15 or >15 to determine if player should take a "Hit" or "Stay", this could later be adjusted to include weighting
based on total cards so far played and total cards still in the deck (ahhhh if only we could all be "Rain Man" and do that at the real table....)
